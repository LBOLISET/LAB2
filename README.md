Here are the step-by-step instructions to set up the web application:

1. Download all the PHP, HTML, JavaScript and SQL files:
   - Retrieve all the necessary files, including PHP scripts, HTML pages, Javascript files and SQL files that constitute the web application. 

2. Upload SQL files into your database:
   - Use the  phpMyAdmin to upload and execute the SQL files into your database. This step creates the required database tables and structures.

3. Modify DB connection details in db.php file to establish a connection to the database:
   - Locate the `db.php` file in your downloaded files. Open the file using a text editor and update the database connection details, including the hostname, username, password, and database name. Ensure that the details match your database configuration.

4. Upload all the PHP and HTML files into Cyberduck:
   - Use an SFTP client like Cyberduck to upload all the PHP and HTML files to your web server.

5. Configure server settings if necessary:
   - Ensure that the server settings, such as file permissions and directory structure, are configured correctly. Set the appropriate permissions to allow the web server to execute PHP scripts and access necessary files.

6. Access the web application:
   - Once all files are uploaded, navigate to the URL where your web application is hosted. This could be the domain name or IP address of your server.
